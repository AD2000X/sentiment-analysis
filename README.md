# Writing Style Differences between Jane Austen and Charles Dickens

Follow the passion to Sentiment Analysis in NLP, we conduct our first sentiment analysis project as our first assignment in study.  
  

## PART 1

This project explores the emotional characteristics of texts written by two celebrated British authors, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, using text mining and sentiment analysis. By obtaining paragraph-level datasets from Kaggle, then filtering and reducing their size, it was possible to analyze polarity (positive/negative) and subjectivity, and visualize the results through tools such as radar charts, box plots, and word clouds.  

The main goal of this study is to compare the emotional tendencies in the writing styles of both authors, in order to verify common literary views. Austen’s works are often seen as humorous and generally positive, with relatively balanced emotional changes. In contrast, Dickens’s writing often shows greater emotional fluctuation, focusing on social injustice, poverty, and the complexity of human nature.  

The findings of this project provide a valuable foundation for future applications, such as developing automated writing style simulations or performing literary text analysis. They also help us better understand the authors’ backgrounds, the historical context they wrote in, and how readers today might respond to their works.

## PART 2

This project aims to build upon earlier research by further examining the stylistic and emotional characteristics found in the works of two renowned British authors, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. In the first phase (CW1) of our study, we discovered that Austen’s writing tends to be more positively inclined overall, while Dickens’s works display greater emotional fluctuation and a higher proportion of neutral sentiment. In this second phase (CW2), we will use the same pre-processed dataset to conduct a more in-depth analysis, including syntactic structure, part-of-speech distribution (adjectives, adverbs, and verbs), and sentiment analysis enriched by compound and subjectivity indices. We will also explore techniques such as TF-IDF, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and semantic search using BERT.  

By integrating both traditional and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, our goal is to present a more comprehensive picture of each author’s stylistic features and emotional tendencies. We will then investigate how different vocabulary, syntax, and characters influence the overall emotional style of the texts. Through systematic corpus analysis, this project not only contributes to a better understanding of the emotional dynamics in classic literary works but also provides valuable insights for future developments in automated writing style simulation, text sentiment analysis, and literary research.
