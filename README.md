# Writing Style Differences between Jane Austen and Charles Dickens

Follow the passion to Sentiment Analysis in NLP, we conduct our first sentiment analysis project as our first assignment in study.

---

## PART 1: Exploring Emotional Characteristics

This project explores the emotional characteristics of texts written by two celebrated British authors, **Jane Austen** and **Charles Dickens**, using **text mining** and **sentiment analysis**. By obtaining **paragraph-level datasets from Kaggle**, then filtering and reducing their size, it was possible to analyze:
- **Polarity** (positive/negative sentiment)
- **Subjectivity**

The results were visualized using:
- **Radar charts**
- **Box plots**
- **Word clouds**

### Goal
The main goal of this study is to compare the **emotional tendencies** in the writing styles of both authors, in order to verify common literary views:
- **Jane Austen**: Often characterized as humorous and generally positive, with relatively balanced emotional changes.
- **Charles Dickens**: Known for greater emotional fluctuation, focusing on themes such as social injustice, poverty, and the complexity of human nature.

### Findings
The findings of this project provide a valuable foundation for:
- Developing **automated writing style simulations**.
- Performing **literary text analysis**.

Additionally, the results help us:
- Better understand the authors’ **backgrounds** and the **historical context** they wrote in.
- Reflect on how **readers today** might respond to their works.

## PART 2: Advancing Research with NLP Techniques

This project aims to build upon earlier research by further examining the stylistic and emotional characteristics found in the works of **Jane Austen** and **Charles Dickens**.

### PART 1 Findings
We discovered:
- **Austen’s writing** tends to be more positively inclined overall.
- **Dickens’s works** display greater emotional fluctuation and a higher proportion of neutral sentiment.

### PART 2 Objectives
We use the same **pre-processed dataset** to conduct a more in-depth analysis:
- **Syntactic structure analysis**
- **Part-of-speech distribution** (adjectives, adverbs, and verbs)
- **Sentiment analysis** enriched by:
  - **Compound sentiment** indices
  - **Subjectivity** indices
  - **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
  - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

### Goal
By integrating both **traditional** and **advanced NLP methods**, we aim to:
- Present a more comprehensive picture of each author’s **stylistic features** and **emotional tendencies**.
- Investigate how different **vocabulary**, **syntax**, and **characters** influence the overall emotional style of the texts.

### Significance
Through systematic corpus analysis, this project contributes to:
- A better understanding of the **emotional dynamics** in classic literary works.
- Insights for:
  - Developing **automated writing style simulations**.
  - Enhancing **text sentiment analysis**.
  - Supporting **literary research**.
